Our project aims to model a hexapedal robot's motion from a PWM signal input. Data on multiple tests of PWM values and the voltage output of two different Worm Geared DC Motors, Model: A58-555-1280 can be found in the MotorsData_rev(1).xlsx. This data was obtained from the Dos Reis et al. paper entitled "Direct current geared motor data: Voltage, current, and speed measured under different experimental conditions" (Dos Reis WPN, Couto GE, Morandin Junior O. Direct current geared motor data: Voltage, current, and speed measured under different experimental conditions. Data Brief. 2022 Jan 6;40:107802. doi: 10.1016/j.dib.2022.107802. PMID: 35036495; PMCID: PMC8752902.) The hexepedal robot we hope to measure is owned by Mark Plecnik of the Notre Dame AME department.
