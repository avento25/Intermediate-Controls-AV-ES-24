# Intermediate-Controls-AV-ES-24
Our project aims to model the velocity of a 2022 Toyota Corolla based on the angle at which the gas pedal is pressed. Data was collected experimentally over several trials. Data was collected driving the same direction down the same road in first gear to minimize the differences in conditions between data collection sessions. The data can be found in the Data folder in the main directory and all relevant MATLAB code is found in the MATLAB folder also linked in the main directory.
