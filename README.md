Our project aims to model a hexapedal robot's motion from a PWM signal input. Data on multiple tests of PWM values and the voltage output of two different Worm Geared DC Motors, Model: A58-555-1280 can be found in the MotorsData_rev(1).xlsx. This data was obtained from the Dos Reis et al. paper entitled "Direct current geared motor data: Voltage, current, and speed measured under different experimental conditions" (Dos Reis WPN, Couto GE, Morandin Junior O. Direct current geared motor data: Voltage, current, and speed measured under different experimental conditions. Data Brief. 2022 Jan 6;40:107802. doi: 10.1016/j.dib.2022.107802. PMID: 35036495; PMCID: PMC8752902.) The hexepedal robot we hope to measure is owned by Mark Plecnik of the Notre Dame AME department. Our Matlab code is stored under the Matlab Branch and currently contains codes showing the position of the robot's foot in the x direction, the position of the robot's foot in the x direction, motor velocity against PWM signal, and robot velocity against PWM signal.
